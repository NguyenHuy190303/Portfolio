to diverse audiences.
EXPERIENCE
2025–Present CEO-Founder, Capybara, On site,
○ Founded a startup with the mission to personalize education, starting with language learning.
○ Leading product strategy, technical architecture, and partner collaboration.
○ Actively working with a diverse team of data scientists, language tutors (English, French, Chinese),
and educational leaders to build a human-centric product.
2024–2025 Project Lead, Sage an Health AI Platform, Vaasa, Finland,
○ Led a team of 4 to develop a comprehensive AI-powered personal health support system.
○ The project achieved a perfect score (5/5) from the university’s evaluation committee and was
architected to serve hundreds of users at low cost.
○ Managed the full product lifecycle, from system design (Agent, MCP, RAG, LLMs) and backend
development (FastAPI) to deployment (Docker), CI/CD with vercel.
2024–Present Team Leader, VLAI, AI VIETNAM, Remote,
○ Leading the research and development of the ”Faithful Visual Question Answering” project.
○ Architected a novel multi-agent decomposed reasoning system (FDR-MA) achieving State-of-the-
Art (SOTA) results.
○ Preparing a scientific paper for submission to a top-tier AI conference (AAAI).
2024–2025 Research Team Leader, Nebula Nesus , AI VIETNAM, Remote,
○ Led the Nebula Nesus research team to develop a novel AI system for dental healthcare diagnostics,
achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results. Demonstrated superior performance in extremely
label-scarce environments (1% of data), improving accuracy by up to +9.32% on the Sleep-EDF
dataset and +8.24% on the HAR dataset compared to CA-TCC (TPAMI).
○ Architected a deep learning pipeline utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze
panoramic dental radiographs, automating the detection of caries and periodontal disease with
high precision.
2024–Present Team member, AIMA, AI VIETNAM, Remote,
○ Member of the research and development of the Dental health care by AI project.
○ Collaborating with international specialists in the field of AI in medicine, specifically dentistry.
Preparing a scientific paper for submission to a top-tier AI Journal (IEEE workshop).
