### ‚ú® **About Me: A Snapshot**

My work revolves around three core pillars: Technical Leadership, Community Building, and Applied Research.

* **Technical & Research Leadership**
    * I lead and have led research teams at organizations like **VLAI** (focusing on Multi-Agent VQA) and **AI Vietnam** (Time-series Analysis).
    * My hands-on leadership is demonstrated by the **Mental Health Support System** project, an end-to-end LLM application I led, which received a **perfect 5/5 score**.

* **Community Building**
    * As the co-founder and co-leader of an **AI community with 975+ members** on Discord, I am passionate about fostering an environment for collaborative learning and development.

* **Core Expertise & Research Interests**
    * My technical expertise lies in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with deep, practical experience in **RAG**, **LlamaIndex**, and frameworks like **PyTorch**.
    * Inspired by the challenge of "under-resourced languages", my long-term goal is to contribute to developing foundational NLP resources for my native language, Vietnamese.
